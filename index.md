Hi, I am Pranav Sampathkumar from Chennai, India.
I am currently a Doctoral Candidate in the Institute for Astroparticle Physics, Karlsruhe Institute for Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany. 

After majoring in Mechanical Engineering for my undergraduate programme, I decided to pursue a career in fundamental Physics.
During my undergrads, I caught up on undergraduate physics, and formally started pursuing a Masters in Physics at TIFR, since Autumn 2016.

## Research Interests:
  - Interpretable Neural Networks for Generative Modelling of Physical Systems
  - Model independent analysis of various physical systems to find deviations from standard physics using anomaly detection techniques
  - High Energy Physics and Cosmology with emphasis on numerical computations and Machine Learning.

## Other Interests:
  - I am interested in Programming in general. I am involved in the development of [freeciv21](https://github.com/longturn/freeciv21). Apart from that, My interests range from History, Procedural Generation and World building.
